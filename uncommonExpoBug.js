While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process. The error message was vague and unhelpful, simply stating that the build failed without providing specific details. I've tried several common troubleshooting steps like cleaning the cache, updating dependencies, and restarting the Expo CLI, but the issue persisted. The build process would start but would eventually stop and report a failure without a meaningful error message.
